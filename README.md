        2. Change the first line of the __TestBase__ class and hard code the value:

                public class TestBase
                {
                    private static final String testobjectApiKey = "<INSERT_API_KEY_HERE>";
    	        
3. Project Dependencies

### Advice/Troubleshooting

1. It may be useful to use a Java IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse to help troubleshoot potential issues. 

2. There may be additional latency when using `RemoteWebDriver` to run tests on Sauce Labs. Timeouts or Waits may need to be increased.
